* Added ability to move rows in list
* make apiReq accept second arg as possible callback.

* Add way to check how many friends the person is premade with (is this even possible anymore?)
	* could check how many other people on this list are in their game, and update their entries as well.
* format match data string somehow (partly done: masteries and runes omitted)
	* create readable champion list of ally/enemy team, along with queue type
	* Add spectate option
* slow down apiReq so that it is at a max of 1/sec (or 10req/10sec)
* Add auto updating (something like update 1 entry on the list every 5 seconds or so)
* make loadList remove current players from list first?
