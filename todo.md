* fix(?) spectate
* further format match string to include banned champs,
	* move spectate option near it maybe

* (TODO1)
	* factor out test request, with key as parameter, to LeagueApi
* Allow using regions other than NA
* Allow analysing past games
* TODO figure out what to do with history string. <pre> tag might help. Also:
	* Maybe let user tab through different matches, to see 1 at a time.
	* The popup window needs to be closeable

* CSS in its own file, or inline in window.html. Use classes to style parts a time.

* limit apiReq so that it is at a max of 1/sec (or 10req/10sec)
* Add auto updating (something like update 1 entry on the list every 5 seconds or so)
* Can check how long since person has completed a game with up to 40 summoners at once.
